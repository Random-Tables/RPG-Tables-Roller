# RPG Table Roller Application

The RPG roller application is a desktop App designed as a tool for Pen & Paper RPG DM/ Creative Fantasy projects.
Like the Loot tables of DnD, it randomly generates items, places, etc.. , the unique part of this project is the modular (composable) nature of the tables file format.
In effect you can create tables replacing descriptive adjectives, such as color with a sub-table meaning each 'roll' can vary greatly adding a further layer depth of descriptiveness.
Another advantage here is the hosting of tables in modular Open Source Repository allowing for a highly extendable Open collection of tables which people can easily extend.

##### Desktop App ?

Currently just a desktop app as they tend to be longer lasting than web sites and it's easier to download and add custom tables to a desktop app.

If I get a good response I will look at create a toolset to help people create random table generators for their websites.

## Status

Currently the app is in it's first iteration whilst I get a feel for interest, if strong I will look into further extending it's functionality

- Tables Roller 👍
- Projects (Saved 'rolls') 👍
- themes (working but lacks polish and options) 😐

- Windows App 👍
- Linux App 👍
- Mac App 😡, either need to bite the buller abd get one or find other build alternatives


## Creating Your own Tables

The github organisation Random-Tables contains Reos for all the Tables
https://github.com/orgs/Random-Tables/repositories
First download one and using a Text editor have a read through the .json files to get a feel for how they are built, it should be fairly simple to replicate the design format as they are quite a simple, readable format.

Tables have a few options for how they generate data, se below
