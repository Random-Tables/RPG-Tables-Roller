# RPG Table Roller Application

The RPG roller application is a desktop App designed as a tool for Pen & Paper RPG DM/ Creative Fantasy projects.
Like the Loot tables of DnD, it randomly generates items, places, etc.. , the unique part of this project is the modular (composable) nature of the tables file format.
In effect you can create tables replacing descriptive adjectives, such as color with a sub-table meaning each 'roll' can vary greatly adding a further layer depth of descriptiveness.
Another advantage here is the hosting of tables in modular Open Source Repository allowing for a highly extendable Open collection of tables which people can easily extend.

### Adding Tables

Once you run the application once, you will find in your documents folder a new folder called `Fantasy-Tables` within that folder is another called `Collections`, inside this folder is where you place new tables, making sure that any folders added have an index.json file inside and not nested within another sub folder:

‚úîÔ∏è
- Fantasy-Tables
  - Collections
    - fantasy-npc@2
      - index.json

‚ùå

- Fantasy-Tables
  - Collections
    - fantasy-npc@2
      - new folder
        - index.json


### Desktop App ?

Currently just a desktop app as they tend to be longer lasting than web sites and it's easier to download and add custom tables to a desktop app.

If I get a good response I will look at create a toolset to help people create random table generators for their websites.

## Status

Currently the app is in it's first iteration whilst I get a feel for interest, if strong I will look into further extending it's functionality

## Creating Your own Tables

The github organisation Random-Tables contains Reos for all the Tables
https://github.com/orgs/Random-Tables/repositories
First download one and using a Text editor have a read through the .json files to get a feel for how they are built, it should be fairly simple to replicate the design format as they are quite a simple, readable format.

Tables have a few options for how they generate data, se below

### Table data types

- String : 'Just type out your text'
- Call : {{table-repo/table-group/table:Default}} - Each 'table-repo' is the id the individual collection has, below that is the grouping and within each group are the actual tables that get called.
- Number: {{Number#20-40}} Returns a random number between 20 & 40
- Dice: {{D#3d6 + 4 + 2d6}} 3d6 is 3 rolls of a 6 sided dice, you can space out multiple additions and all of them will be added together
